AI-powered waste management prototype project
# ♻️ Reloop Smart Bin

AI-powered smart bin system for reducing food waste at the source — built for markets, vendors, cold chains, and farms across Africa.

## 🌍 Mission

Food waste is a $1 trillion problem globally — and up to 50% of produce in Africa spoils before it’s ever eaten. We're building smart bins and waste prediction tools to help vendors, farmers, and storage operators reduce spoilage, improve traceability, and monetize waste.

## 🔧 What We're Building

- **Smart Bin Hardware:** IoT-enabled bins with weight sensors, temperature tracking, and waste volume detection
- **AI Prediction Engine:** Forecasts spoilage based on weather, storage conditions, and market demand cycles
- **Waste Dashboard:** Web app to monitor waste levels, trends, and get insights
- **Circular System:** Connects to upcycling partners for biogas, compost, or resale

## 💡 Use Cases

- Open-air market vendors losing produce daily
- Cold storage operators seeking better tracking
- Logistics hubs looking to reduce post-harvest losses
- Farmers needing real-time spoilage insights

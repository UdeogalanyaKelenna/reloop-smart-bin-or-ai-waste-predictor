AI-powered waste management prototype project
# ♻️ Reloop Smart Bin

AI-powered smart bin system for reducing food waste at the source — built for markets, vendors, cold chains, and farms across Africa.

## 🌍 Mission

Food waste is a $1 trillion problem globally — and up to 50% of produce in Africa spoils before it’s ever eaten. We're building smart bins and waste prediction tools to help vendors, farmers, and storage operators reduce spoilage, improve traceability, and monetize waste.

## 🔧 What We're Building

- **Smart Bin Hardware:** IoT-enabled bins with weight sensors, temperature tracking, and waste volume detection
- **AI Prediction Engine:** Forecasts spoilage based on weather, storage conditions, and market demand cycles
- **Waste Dashboard:** Web app to monitor waste levels, trends, and get insights
- **Circular System:** Connects to upcycling partners for biogas, compost, or resale

## 💡 Use Cases

- Open-air market vendors losing produce daily
- Cold storage operators seeking better tracking
- Logistics hubs looking to reduce post-harvest losses
- Farmers needing real-time spoilage insights

## 📦 Reloop Structure (coming soon)

```bash
/firmware/         # Code for sensors and bin controller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
/ai-models/        # ML notebooks + scripts for waste prediction
/web-dashboard/    # Frontend/backend for waste analytics dashboard
/docs/             # Specs, designs, pilot plans, investor briefs

## 🚀 Status

- Currently in **prototyping phase**
- Preparing for **YC** and pilot testing in **Nigeria**
- Open to **collaborators**, engineers, and climate-tech advisors

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We’re early-stage and actively looking for:

- **AI/ML engineers** (time-series, forecasting, optimization)
- **Hardware/Firmware engineers** (IoT, embedded systems)
- **Web devs** (React, Python, Firebase, etc.)
